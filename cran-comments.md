## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs on any platform.

There was one NOTE: 3 days since last update.

I apologize for this rapid minor release. I introduced one minor bug in 0.2.0 that was
not picked up by my tests. I have fixed the bug and added tests. I understand
CRAN is staffed by volunteers whose time is important and I will not make a habit
of making these rapid releases. Thank you.
